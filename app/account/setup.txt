Given a JSON file in the form 
[
    {
        "Symbol": "A",
        "Company Name": "Agilent Technologies, Inc.",
        "Industry": "Diagnostics & Research"
    },
    {
        "Symbol": "AA",
        "Company Name": "Alcoa Corporation",
        "Industry": "Aluminum"
    },
    {
        "Symbol": "AACI",
        "Company Name": "Armada Acquisition Corp. I",
        "Industry": "Shell Companies"
    },
    {
        "Symbol": "AACT",
        "Company Name": "Ares Acquisition Corporation II",
        "Industry": "Shell Companies"
    }
]

Give me a python script that when given a json like the one I just mentioned will give me an updated JSON that will aggregate and combine all of the companies 
whose 'Industry' are the same. 

An example result JSON would be:


[
    Category 
    {
    "Aluminum":
    {
        {
            "Symbol": "AA",
            "Company Name": "Alcoa Corporation"
        }
    },
    "Diagnostics & Research:"
    {  
        {
            "Symbol": "A", 
            "Company Name": "Agilent Technologies, Inc.", 
        }
    }
    "Shell Companies":
    {
        {
            "Symbol": "AACI",
            "Company Name": "Armada Acquisition Corp. I"
        },
        {
            "Symbol": "AACT",
            "Company Name": "Ares Acquisition Corporation II"
        }
    }
    }
]
